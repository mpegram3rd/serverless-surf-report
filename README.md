# Serverless RVA Surf Report
## What
The idea here is to create a little website / API that can be used to pull some of the data you would typically see on the 
Instagram @rvasurfreport.   This typically consists of some data about the current water temperature and water gauge height, 
graphs showing the projected changes, and usually some small description of the best place on the Mighty Jimmy to go surfing 
based on the current water level.  

## Why
The main reason this repository exists is for me to explore using the Serverless framework, and to practice architecting and
developing a cloud based application.
